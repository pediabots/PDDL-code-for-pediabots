To run this code, go https://editor.planning.domains/. To do this, you will need to press the File button. Then, you must press the "New" button, which will show up directly under the file button, which will create a new file. At this point, you should have two files listed in the left pane called unnamed1.pddl and unnamed2.pddl. Change their names to domain.pddl and problem.pddl. Then, copy the contents of this repository's domain.pddl and problem.pddl into their respective files. Then, you will then need to press the "solver" button at the top, which brings up a Compute plan window. Set the Domain to be the domain.pddl file, and the Problem to be the problem.pddl file. Then choose BFWS for the solver. Then press the green "Plan" button. Then wait until it says Plan is ready in the lower right corner. Then you can see the plan it output by clicking on the Plan file that was created on the left pane.

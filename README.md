To run this code, go https://editor.planning.domains/. To do this, you will need to press the File button. Then, you must press the "New" button, which will show up directly under the file button. After you do this, paste the domain file (domain.pddl) in the first file and the problem file (problem.pddl) in the second file. Then, you will then need to press the "solver" button at the top. Before clicking the green "Plan" button, you will need to make sure the domain file is set to the first file, and the problem file is set to the second file. Once you have made sure of this, press the green "Plan" button.
